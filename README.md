So, the requirements for this project are:

Anaconda (way simpler to install LLVMlite through conda than pip)

LLVMlite

  $ conda install --channel=numba llvmlite
  
RPLY (same as PLY but with a better API)

  $ conda install -c conda-forge rply
  
LLC (LLVM static compiler)

GCC (or other linking tool)
